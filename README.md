# Smart Building and BIPV Systems – Independent Research

This repository documents independent research on smart building technologies and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. The work explores how building envelopes, sensors, distributed energy systems, and digital controls can be combined to enhance energy performance, comfort, and on-site renewable generation.

The research integrates architectural considerations, solar design, building physics, and data analytics to demonstrate how BIPV and smart building components interact within a modern built environment.

## Research Objectives

1. Study the feasibility and design requirements of BIPV systems for façades and rooftops.
2. Analyze the impact of solar exposure, shading, orientation, and material selection on BIPV output.
3. Investigate smart building technologies involving sensors, automation, thermal comfort, and energy-use optimization.
4. Develop analytical methods to interpret building sensor data and evaluate performance.
5. Explore building–grid interactions, including load shaping, demand flexibility, and PV integration.
6. Provide a structured reference for BIPV and smart building design concepts, supported by independent literature review and data experiments.
